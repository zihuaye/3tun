.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"

.LP
This section, named
.BR options ,
specifies general options to use by
.BR vtund (8).
Possible \fIkeyword\fRs are:
.IP \fBtype\fR\ \fBstand\fR|\fBinetd\fR
server type. \fBvtund\fR(8) can operate in standalone
mode (\fBstand\fR), that is the default, or be invoked from
.BR inetd (8).

.IP \fBport\ \fIportnumber\fR
server port number to listen on or connect to.
By default, \fBvtund\fR(8) uses port 5000.

.IP \fBbindaddr\ \fIlist\fR
server listen address. Used to force vtund to bind to the specific
address and port in server mode.  Format:
.nf
  \fBbindaddr\fR {
   \fIoption \fIvalue\fR;
  };
.fi
.IP
\fBbindaddr\fR options:
.RS
.IP \fBiface\ \fIif_name\fR
use interface address \fIif_name\fR as the bind address.
.IP \fBaddr\ \fIaddr\fR
bind address.  Can be either IP address or host name.
.RE

.IP \fBtimeout\ \fIseconds\fR
General timeout.

.IP \fBpersist\fR\ \fByes\fR|\fBkeep\fR|\fBno\fR
persist mode.  If \fByes\fR, the client will try to reconnect to the server
after connection termination.  If \fBkeep\fR, the client will not remove
and re-add the \fBtun\fIXX\fR or \fBtap\fIXX\fR device when reconnecting.
If \fBno\fR, the client will exit (default).
This option is ignored by the server.

.IP \fBsyslog\fR\ \fBnumber\fR|\fBname\fR
syslog facility specification, either numeric or name (from syslog (3)).

.IP \fBppp\ \fIpath\fR
path to \fBpppd\fR(8) program.  Can be used in session sections.

.IP \fBifconfig\ \fIpath\fR
path to \fBifconfig\fR(8) program.  Can be used in session sections.

.IP \fBroute\ \fIpath\fR
path to \fBroute\fR(8) program.  Can be used in session sections.

.IP \fBip\ \fIpath\fR
path to \fBiproute\fR(8) program.  Can be used in session sections.

.IP \fBfirewall\ \fIpath\fR
program for the firewall setup.

.LP
All the \fBppp\fR, \fBifconfig\fR, \fBroute\fR and \fBfirewall\fR
parameters can specify a filename for corresponding program or
equivalent (or shell script).  This parameters are used in session sections
to setup network interfaces.

.SH "SESSION OPTIONS"

.LP
Session options can be specified inside session section or
inside \fBdefault\fR section.  Default parameters apply
to any session section but can be overwritten there.
Parameters are:

.IP \fBpasswd\ \fIsecret\fR

client and server.

.IP \fBtype\ \fItype\fR
type of tunnel.  Possible tunnel types are:
.RS

Default tunnel type is \fBtty\fR.
This option is ignored by client.

.IP \fBdevice\ \fIdev\fR
network device to use.  You can choose
\fBtap\fIXX\fR for \fBether\fR tunnel
or \fBtun\fIXX\fR for \fBtun\fR tunnel.
By default \fBvtund\fR(8) will automatically select available device.

.IP \fBproto\ \fBtcp\fR|\fBudp\fR
protocol to use.  By default, \fBvtund\fR(8) will use TCP protocol.
UDP is recommended for \fBether\fR and \fBtun\fR tunnels only.
This option is ignored by the client.

.IP \fBtimeout\ \fIsecounds\fR
Connect timeout.

.IP \fBlzo\fR
LZO compression (if compiled in)
.RE
.IP
You can also specify \fIlevel\fR of compression using one
digit (1 is best speed, 9 is best compression ratio).
This option ignored by the client.
.IP \fBencrypt\ \fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
enable or disable encryption.  This option ignored by the client.
.IP \fBkeepalive\ \fByes\fR|\fBno\fR

.IP
\fB\'\fR (single quotes) - group arguments
.br
\fB\\\fR (back slash) - escape character
